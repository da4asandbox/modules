## Overview

This class examines one of the major sources of data used by researchers, activists, and policy-makers today: the US Census. By working with Census data and studying the history of how it has collected and categorized information about the US population, students learn how political and social categories have been mapped onto quantifiable data and some of the limitations of this population-level data.

## Learning Goals

1. Study the social and cultural history behind census data and its creation
2. Understand the process of categorization and data collection
3. How to work with tabular datasets

## Readings

#### Instructor Note:
> _Dan Bouk’s Census Stories, USA is a collection of blog posts written during the course of his research for his book, Democracy’s Data. They are written in a more informal style than a traditional academic monograph, and offer bite-sized windows into the social, political, and cultural history behind the US Census. They are, above all, a reminder that data itself has a history and one that is wrapped up in the lives of individual people._

## Agenda

- Activity: Census Data Today (15 min.)
- Discussion: Dan Bouk, Census Stories, USA (20 min.)
- Tutorial: Spreadsheet Functions and Census Data (25 min.)
- Discussion: Who Counts in the US Census? (15 min.)

## Activity: Census Data Today

#### Instructor Note:
> _This activity has students explore modern census data for their home state. They should get a sense for what kind of data the government is collecting along with sparking their interest about some of the data insights into their state. This will set up the rest of today’s discussion about how this information has been collected and used at different points in American history._

### Individually:
- Find the the US Census Bureau’s “data profile” of your home state:
    - Go to https://data.census.gov/map 
    - Click on your home state
    - Click “View Profile”
- Spend several minutes and skim through the data profile for your state. Take note of the following:
    - What KIND of information is being shown on this page? What are the different sources of this information?
    - What are 3 interesting results or patterns that you didn’t know or found surprising about your home state?
    - What other data about your state do you wish you could find on this page?

### In small groups:
- Share what you found with your group members and collectively come up with 1 interesting result + 1 additional piece of data you want to know more about.

### Whole class:
- Each group share your chosen 1 interesting result + 1 additional piece of data that you want to know more about.

## Discussion: Dan Bouk, Census Stories, USA

### Individual Free-Write:
- Which of these “stories” did you find most compelling and why? 

### Small Group Discussion:
- Assign one of the “stories” to each group.
- Who is the main character in this story?
- What is the narrative arc of the story?
- What is one bigger takeaway from this story that helps you understand the history of data?

### Whole Class Debrief:
- What sorts of questions do these readings raise about the census data you looked at earlier for your home state?
- How do you think this modern data was collected?


## Tutorial: Spreadsheet Functions and Census Data

#### Instructor Note:
> _These activities will help students get more comfortable working with spreadsheets and understanding how spreadsheet functions work while also highlighting some of the political choices that shape the Census data and how it is recorded and categorized._

### Get the Data
Today you're going to be learning some more spreadsheet skills using state-level census data from 2010 and 2020. To get started, make a copy of the following Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqIsMvJW5EddzWiOk4jddqNojcNkN_IaNsGNtfmZL7w/edit?usp=sharing.



### Spreadsheet Functions
Functions
Watch minute 20:00-28:30 of this video: https://youtu.be/TENAbUa-R-w?t=1200 

Apply some of the functions you learned in the above video to answer the following by in the Population Change sheet in your Google Sheet:
What was the change in total population for each state between 2010 and 2020? Write a function in Column D (red) that calculates the net gain or loss for each state.
What was the percentage change in population for each state? Write a function in Column E (yellow) that calculates the net change in population as a percentage of the state’s 2010 population. 
How many people live in each state as a percentage of the entire country’s population? Write a function in Column F (blue) that calculates the 2020 population of each state as a percentage of the combined 2020 population of all states. 

Use the spreadsheet [sorting feature](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681) to sort the Population Change sheet so you can see patterns:
- What states LOST population between 2010 and 2020? [Illinois, Mississippi, and West Virginia)
- What three states had the largest GAIN in population as a percentage of their 2010 population? [Utah, Idaho, Texas]

The total U.S. population counted by the 2020 Census was 331,449,281. However, in a number of news articles and other data tables you will find a different, higher number: 334,735,155. What accounts for this discrepancy of more than 3 million people?

Teacher’s Note:
The answer: Puerto Rico. This last part of the tutorial sets up a broader discussion about who “counts” in the US Census and how certain people are categorized/counted.

In your spreadsheet:
Insert a new row into the sheet and add the missing data.
Sort your rows by the 2020 population. 
Where does your new row fall in a national rank of states by population? What states is it comparable to?


## Discussion: Who Counts in the US Census?
