# Overview {#overview}

This class introduces students to studying data as a historical artifact - the idea that data is not simply quantifiable information, but that all data has a history behind it that has shaped its production and use.

# Learning Goals {#goals}

1. Establish a larger theoretical framework from Data Feminism to approach data as a historical artifact
2. Help students explore a particular form of historical data (HOLC Redlining Maps) and how biases of race, class, and religion shaped their production during the 1930s.
3. Introduce students to the [Data Biography](historicizing-data/data-biography) assignment and start to apply some of its framework to the HOLC Redlining Maps.

# Readings {#readings}

# Activities {#activities}

## Discussion: "Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach" {#activity1}

### Defining Concepts
- **In small groups:** try to come up with a working definition of the following concepts from in your own words
    - Counterdata
    - "The Pitfalls of Proof"
    - Data Ethics vs. Data Justice
- **As a whole class:** each group share your working definition and the instructor should write these definitions on the board. Other groups should add to these definitions or ask for clarifications as needed.

### Applying Concepts
- Look around the classroom. Brainstorm as many ideas as you can for kinds of data you might try and collect about what you see. Ex. "We could count the number of people wearing glasses."
- In small groups: choose one of your ideas and try to apply at least one of the three concepts (Counterdata, “The Perils of Proof,” and Data Ethics vs. Data Justice) you defined from "Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach" to that idea:
    - **Negative**: How would you irresponsibly collect your chosen data? How might that data get misused?
    - **Positive**: How would you collect this data in a way that follows one or more of the three concepts defined above?

#### Instructor Note:
> _Some additional discussion questions based on the readings:_
> 
> _- Do you think the distinction between "data ethics" vs. "data justice" is a useful one?_
> 
> _- Can you think of other examples of "counterdata" that weren't mentioned in this chapter?_

## Exploring HOLC Redlining Maps {#activity2}

#### Instructor Note:
> _In this activity, students use an interactive mapping project, *Mapping Inequality*, which has scanned, georeferenced, and overlaid HOLC maps from the 1930s onto modern cities. These maps were referenced in the *Data Feminism* reading for this module. This allows students to zoom into different nieighborhoods and explore how this federal agency overlaid conceptions of race, class, and ethnicity onto their grading system for mortgage lending. This activity uses **Denver, Colorado**, as its map, but teachers can substitute another city that might be more familiar for their students. This does require finding some suitable groupings of areas for students to zero in on._

### Introduction

In small groups: You read a bit about the mortgage risk maps created by ==the Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)=={Q3139614} during the 1930s. In this activity you're going to explore one of these maps from **Denver, Colorado**. Each group will be assigned one particular area of the city to investigate on the map:

- Group 1: A3, A4, A5, B5
- Group 2: B10, C16, D7, D8
- Group 3: D6, D12, D13, D15
- Group 4: C19, D7, D10, D14

Here is some background to get you started:

#### Instructor Note:
> _Once you've selected your  map you'll need to do some investigating to come up with several areas of the city to assign to groups. In this case, the four areas of Denver encompass a range of socio-economic and racial dynamics (both historically and today): a wealthy neighborhood located next to a park, a historically black neighborhood, an immigrant community, etc._

### Explore the Data

*In small groups:*

1.  Open this [1938 interactive map of Denver](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.71/-105.117&city=denver-co) produced by the ==Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)=={Q3139614}
2.  Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the site and its interface. Try to get a handle on what kind of information is there and how to navigate the site. **Bonus**: try to find your school, home, church, favorite restaurant, etc.
3.  Locate the area of map assigned to your group by zooming and “panning” (moving) around the map.
4.  Click on each of the sections assigned to your group and read the accompanying notes that the mapmaker recorded for that area. Focus on the following text: **1. Area Characteristics**, **2. Inhabitants** , **5. Clarifying Remarks**.
5. One member of the group take notes on the following:
- Were your sections marked as generally low or high risk?
- What factors in the accompanying text seemed to contribute to those “grades” of low risk or high risk?
- What’s there today? *Note: If you click Map Options -> Polygons you can see the current map of the city underneath.*

### Whole Class Discussion
- Each group share some patterns they noticed in their area.
- Entire class: What seem to be the common factors that the mapmakers used to determine the "lending risk" of different areas of the city?
- Entire class: What do you notice about the **differences** between these areas and neighborhoods, both in the 1930s and today?

## Data Biography of HOLC Redlining Maps {#activity3}

### Small Groups:
Your main assignment for this module is to produce a "data biography" about a historical dataset.[^1] A "data biography" is an attempt to narrate the particular history of a dataset - the when, where, how, why, etc. of its production. Today, we're going to practice this approach using the HOLC redlining maps that you explored.

[^1]: Heather Krause provides a working definition of "data biography" in ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data"](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/) *Global Investigative Journalism Network* (March 27, 2017).

As a group, navigate to the [Introduction page for the Mapping Inequality project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/). Skim through the Introductory text from the website and draw on your own experience with navigating one of the maps  to try and answer the following questions about ***the HOLC maps that produced in the 1930s*** (not the website itself):

- **What** kind of information about a given city and its residents did the HOLC organization collect and visualize through its maps?
- **Who** originally collected this information?
- **How** did they collect this information?
- **When** did they collect this information?
- **Where** did this information come from? What was its geographical coverage?
- **Why** did they collect it? What were the motivations behind the HOLC mapmaking initiative?

### Whole Class Discussion:
- Each group share how they answered one data biography question (What, Who, How, When, Where, Why). 
- How does understanding the “biography” of why and how these maps were created inform your understanding of the city’s history? What impact might these maps have had on its development? 
- What ways could you ethically use these maps in contemporary data advocacy projects? What ways should you avoid using the maps?
